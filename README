NineDayGame
-----------
Created by Alex Williams and Ryan Fox.

To build and run, use the ./run script in the base directory. If you have `redo`, it will use that. Otherwise, you get to suffer the the long `do` build process. ;)

The build scripts assume that libtcod v1.5.0 is available in ./libraries/libtcod-1.5.0

libtcod is available at: http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/download/

Engine Components:
Lore - Contains all of the game data: maps, items, etc.
Kobold - The 3D engine
Goblin - The 2D engine
